                    <p class="p1">This site is dedicated to, well, visual novel oddities! Anything could be an oddity, magazines, fan-games, merch even! There's also some other<br>
                    visual novel related things like recommendations and reviews from  yours truly! This website, as a whole, is meant to show appreciation to one <br>
                    of my favorite, lesser talked about mediums! As you can see, I really like Clannad! It's my favorite visual novel, but I won't say too much here.<br>
                    Check out the <a href="clannadcorner.html">Clannad Corner</a> for my thoughts and other goodies. Speaking of, how about I introduce you to the different pages on this<br>
                    goofy little website!<br>
                    <br>
                    Before we get into a description of each corner of this website I'd like to tell you why I named them "corners" in the first place. I always<br>
                    thought the idea of having my own corner of the internet was super neat, and so I named each topic of this website after that! I guess I<br>
                    never did say what a "corner" in the terms of this website is, sorry ^-^. They're very simple though, basically just a place for a specific<br>
                    topic related to visual novels! So let's get to what topics this website has shall we!</p>
                    
                    <div class="bimg1"><a href="clannadcorner.html"><img src="images/clannadcorner.png" alt="Clannad Corner" style="width:160px; height:160px;"></a></div>
                    <p class="b1"><font size="+2">Clannad Corner</font></p>
                    <p class="p2">First up is the Clannad Corner! This is the place where I talk about the series Clannad! There you will find reviews of each route of the visual<br>
                    novel, the anime and even the theatrical film! There's also other neat things like fun facts and, of course, obscure media. Hope to see you there!</p>
                    
                    <div class="bimg2"><a href="vndscorner.html"><img src="images/vndscorner.png" alt="vnds Corner" style="width: 160px; height: 160px;"></a></div>
                    <p class="b2"><font size="+2">vnds Corner</font></p>
                    <p class="p3">The vnds Corner is dedicated to the homebrew application vnds! It lets you play fan ports of visual novels on the Nintendo DS, PSP and<br>
                    even Android! You'll find general information along with a step-by-step guide on how to get vnds up and running. There's even some stuff<br>
                    on lesser known GBA and DS visual novels!</p>
                    
                    <div class="bimg3"><a href="mandmcorner.html"><img src="images/mandmcorner.png" alt="M and M Corner" style="width: 160px; height: 160px;"></a></div>
                    <p class="b3"><font size="+2">M 'n M Corner</font></p>
                    <p class="p4">M n' M does not stand for the sweet candy! It stands for merchandise and magazines, so that's exactly what you'll find there! I really get<br>
                    a kick out of weird plushies and figures of my favorite characters, so I wanted to share that! I also find mentions of things I like in physical<br>
                    print really neat, the more obscure the better!</p>
                    
                    <div class="bimg4"><a href="fancorner.html"><img src="images/fancorner.png" alt="Fan Corner" style="width: 160px; height: 160px;"></a></div>
                    <p class="b4"><font size="+2">Fan Corner</font></p>
                    <p class="p5">As the name suggests, the Fan Corner is for all things made by fans! Though mostly fan-games to be truthful. There's a lot of real odd things<br>
                    there, so it's one of my favorite places! I even go about ranking and telling you how to play the games that take a bit more work to get running.<br>
                    I really hope you check it out!</p>
                    
                    <div class="bimg5"><a href="classicscorner.html"><img src="images/classicscorner.png" alt="Classics Corner" style="width: 160px; height: 160px;"></a></div>
                    <p class="b5"><font size="+2">Classics Corner</font></p>
                    <p class="p6">Classic visual novels is what this corner is all about! This mostly focuses on visual novels from the 80s and 90s, there's some interesting older<br>
                    content! A lot of that older content does contain "adult moments", I don't show any images, but I do talk about those moments. It's hard to talk<br>
                    about some of these visual novels without mentioning stuff like that, but I hope to see you there if you don't mind!</p>
                    
                    <div class="bimg6"><a href="mangacorner.html"><img src="images/mangacorner.png" alt="Manga Corner" style="width: 160px; height: 160px;"></a></div>
                    <p class="b6"><font size="+2">Manga Corner</font></p>
                    <p class="p7">Visual novels often get adapted into manga, so that's what the Manga Corner is for! Since visual novels are typically non-linear I find it<br>
                    very interesting how authors adapt those into linear stories. I also really like the short, humor based 4-komas!</p>
                    
                    <div class="bimg7"><a href="musiccorner.html"><img src="images/musiccorner.png" alt="Music Corner" style="width: 160px; height: 160px;"></a></div>
                    <p class="b7"><font size="+2">Music Corner</font></p>
                    <p class="p8">I love music! So why not have a section of my website for it, right? I'm not a music maestro, so I just talk about music I like from visual novels.<br>
                    I also talk about some city pop and other non-visual novel music because I'd really like to share some neat tunes!</p>
                    
                    <div class="bimg8"><a href="oddcorner.html"><img src="images/oddcorner.png" alt="Odd Corner" style="width: 160px; height: 160px;"></a></div>
                    <p class="b8"><font size="+2">Odd Corner</font></p>
                    <p class="p9">Finally is the Odd Corner! This is kind of the catch-all place of the website that houses things that wouldn't fit into the other categories.<br>
                    Of course this is named after the website itself and includes some odd things!</p>
